_what is something I can do everyday?_

- drawing?
- painting?
- p5?

need to make things everyday to build up collection/content for future videos. Can't do it when my head isn't in the right space though. Do I need to reorganize my routine? Is this routine working for me? 

**feel like I can't think straight anymore...**

Should I get goals or objectives? Go back to making a video once a week? Needs to be within a exact timeframe? ugh fuck I need to figure out how to schedule my time because this isn't working and I'm not getting psyched on anything which is killing my spirit, need to revive it. Need to work during tiff's reading time. Can't be distracted my phone. Need to watch less TV. So addicted right now. And weirdly tired, always tired. Not excited by anything... I shouldn't be too down though. The room is coming along. I've been playing guitar, working out, and applying for jobs. So that's good, I'm just in a weird space right now. Remember to do what you want to do! What is it that I want to do? Draw, paint, animate. Need to make scenes. What do I want to make? Think back, in discuss with a better version of yourself, in conversation with nature, beauty in the organic, in the twisting up of emotions and bodies, technology and plants. Ok, do that. Do I want to do that right now or watch a movie? LOL fuck. idk. this ear ache is fucking killing me too. remember, everything you do is with an artistic spirit. My art isn't a technical virtuositic expression of skill and beauty, it is about having fun, laughing at myself and everything, my dark sense of humor, it is joyful in its depression, it is catharitc and shouldn't be stressful. 

_What are my starting places?_
