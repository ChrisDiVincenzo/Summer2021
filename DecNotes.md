## Thinking and Working

Am I doing enough? 

- I'm happy yes. happy just reading and drawing
- I can push myself though, or at least bounce back and forth
- what have I not kept up with:

_CODING & VIDEOING_

I guess writing too actually...

but i'm happy where I'm at, what more do I want?

- installing Adobe Animate
- I do like the diagrams I should keep up with those instead of just doing the drawings, those also can be turned into videos more easily
- what is a process i can do to help continue to do that? 
- need to upload my drawings I guess? 

Don't need to do everything, don't overwhelm yourself!

Am i a digital artist? Do I still want to be? Does it bother me if I am not? What do I want to be? What will make me happy?
