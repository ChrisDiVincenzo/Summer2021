### May 20

Graduated yesterday... feeling weird, anticlimatic, doesn't feel over, not sure what to do next... worried about getting a job... made a list of what I want/need to keep working on:

- p5.js sketches
- videos
- animation
- unity/blender
- drawing/painting
- writing (in this note taking form and in other forms)
- research
- read
- raspberry pi (clay covered robo farmers)
- workout
- get a job

do I take a break? Do I really want to? What will emerge next? what would taking a break look like? I want to work on stuff for fun, start writing and drawing and coding. Things will start to emerge. what is my starting point, do I need to create more data/content for projects? go back to video, what is my still, has it changed? what do I want to make? How can my audience be a better/future version of myself? Should I draw them? or code them? what do they do, what do they look like, are they human? 

how should I organize my day(s)?

do I want to make tools? collages? I like making tools that I could "use" for something? So I want to make a game? I want to make more useless games, games that subvert themselves I guess. Need to keep thinking and writing, don't stop writing...

### May 21

thinking about potential art class. Want to make a list of resources for students for presentations. Rhizome, Ubu, eflux, museum websites, library? list of artists, topics, look at purchase classes

### May 25

Applying for jobs... Do I want to be an assistant professor more than high school art teacher? Which is more realistic? or go back to being equipment tech person? B&H and RFCUNY contacts... will I start working on projects again soon?

thinking about writing again... should I write some random stuff for future content? picturing a written work with my twisted creatures crwaling around it. Do i want to write a story? not exactly? but kinda less. lets explore this more. what is this impulse to write. I feel accomplished from the thesis paper. How can i do soemthing more like me in that medium? should it involve programing? Yes I think.

do I want to make more creatures right now? do I want to make a program? what do I feel like doing? Can I take a breath and not feel bad about not wanting to do stuff for fun? I still want to do stuff though. There is a difference there.

take a break from applying to jobs tomorrow and just work on some fun stuff...

its all about balance

should also find a bunch of good resources to help stay up to date on art stuff...
