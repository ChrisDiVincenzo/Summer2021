### May 20

Graduated yesterday... feeling weird, anticlimatic, doesn't feel over, not sure what to do next... worried about getting a job... made a list of what I want/need to keep working on:

- p5.js sketches
- videos
- animation
- unity/blender
- drawing/painting
- writing (in this note taking form and in other forms)
- research
- read
- raspberry pi (clay covered robo farmers)
- workout
- get a job

do I take a break? Do I really want to? What will emerge next? what would taking a break look like? I want to work on stuff for fun, start writing and drawing and coding. Things will start to emerge. what is my starting point, do I need to create more data/content for projects? go back to video, what is my still, has it changed? what do I want to make? How can my audience be a better/future version of myself? Should I draw them? or code them? what do they do, what do they look like, are they human? 

how should I organize my day(s)?

do I want to make tools? collages? I like making tools that I could "use" for something? So I want to make a game? I want to make more useless games, games that subvert themselves I guess. Need to keep thinking and writing, don't stop writing...
